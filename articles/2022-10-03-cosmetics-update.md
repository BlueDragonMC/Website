For our latest update, we wanted to revisit and redesign a system from previous iterations of BlueDragon: Cosmetics. This time, we have put much thought into the inner workings of the system to make sure it is flexible and easy to add new cosmetic items. Look forward to some limited-time cosmetics coming with special events in the near future.

_All cosmetic items are decorative and are bought with coins that are only earned by playing on the server. We will **never** add any pay-to-win features._

## Shop NPCs

There are three NPCs around the lobby that allow you to access the shop. They all take you to the same menu at the moment.

Each NPC, when right-clicked, opens a cosmetics menu. From there, you can select a category and collection, and purchase, equip, and unequip cosmetics.

## Current Cosmetics List

### Global

**Firework Color** _(The fireworks shown at the end of every game)_ - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Rainbow

### Lobby

**Double Jump Effect** _(Particle effects that display in a ring around you every time you double jump in the Lobby)_ - Note

**Hat** - Space Helmet, Ice, Slime, Honey, Jack-o-Lantern, Compass, Clock, Netherite Helmet, Creeper Head, Zombie Head, Player (Steve) Head, Skeleton Skull, Wither Skeleton Skull, Dragon Head

### FastFall

**Boots** _(Decorative boots with special effects)_ - Leather, Netherite, Midas (sets nearby blocks to gold), TNT (explodes on death)

### WackyMaze

**Stick** _(Customize the knockback stick you use)_ - Fish, Oak Door, Bamboo, Netherite Hoe, Dead Bush

## Final Notes

We are looking to greatly expand our currently-small list of cosmetics and bring this new system to all of our games. If you have any suggestions please reply to this thread or let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3gvSPdW).

Have a great day!
