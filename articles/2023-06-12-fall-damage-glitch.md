Today, we've finally fixed an important issue with FastFall. The bug where fall damage sometimes doesn't happen is now patched.

Unfortunately, we needed to clear leaderboard times that were created with this bug, but we will be automatically granting the **Midas Boots** to anyone affected. Please contact me (ex4) or Flux on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3gvSPdW) if you have any questions or concerns.

More content is coming very soon, but we wanted to release this patch as soon as possible!

As always, have a great day!
