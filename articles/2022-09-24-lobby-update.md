We have been working on ways to make the lobby larger and more interactive, and in this post I will share a few of the biggest improvements.

## Combat Zone
Want to have a quick fight before you join a minigame? Now you can!

Anyone inside the red square will have PvP enabled, and be given iron armor and a diamond sword.
## Jukebox
Maybe you just want to relax while listening to some music. Well, it's your lucky day! By right-clicking the jukebox located on the ground near spawn, you can play any Minecraft music disc for everyone in the lobby to enjoy.

## Parkour
The lobby parkour has been overhauled, and tons of features have been added. Here's how it works:
- Step on the pressure plate to begin a course.
- The new system automatically keeps track of your time and records your best time to the leaderboard.
- Double jumping is disabled during a parkour run.
- When you die, the run is automatically cancelled.

A new course has also been added in the cave under spawn (see below), and some minor adjustments have been made to the World Tour Parkour.

## Map Changes
We have added some new areas to explore in the lobby!

Have a great day!
