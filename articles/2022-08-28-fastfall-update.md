For our event today, we've rolled out some changes to FastFall including some new block palettes!

All themes have the same chances of slime blocks and the same density, but they each have their own unique block palette.
## At-a-glance Game Status

We've added a new action bar that shows your position, blocks ahead, and health, all in one place.
## Leading Player
When a player takes the lead, players are now notified by a ping, chat message, and title. The leading player is also glowing.
## Spawnpoint Changes
FastFall games now have 4 spawnpoints around 5 blocks apart from each other. This makes it easier to scout a route before the game starts.

As always, any suggestions can be submitted in the Ideas section of the forums or on our Discord server.

We hope you enjoy the new changes!
