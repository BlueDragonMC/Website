It's been more than four months since BlueDragon has received a major update, but this game is worth the wait! Inspired by one Mineplex's best games, BlueDragon's **Dominate** has a unique set of maps and kits that completely change the game. Keep reading to learn about some of the game's exciting features.

## Capture Points
Each map has three **capture points**, which are the objectives of the game. Each second you stand on a point increases its **capture percent**. Once the objective reaches 100 percent, the team that owns it will earn **2 points** per second. Use the scoreboard and colored beacons at each objective to determine which team owns which capture point.

## Kits
Dominate currently has **7 kits**, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. As usual, all kits are free and unlocked by default. Some focus on mobility, while others focus on attack or defense.

### Mobility
- **Swimmer**: Can swim much faster than normal.
- **Glider**: Has a fast elytra for quickly escaping fights or traversing the map.

### Attack
- **Colonizer**: Can take objectives 1.5 times as fast as normal players.
- **Assassin**: Has a diamond sword and the invisibility effect (no nametag).

### Defense
- **Tank**: Has iron armor.
- **Sniper**: Has a [Paintbrawl](/blog/2023-02-19-new-game-paintbrawl)-like sniper rifle that can kill most enemies in 3 hits.

### Tactical
- **Bomber**: Has throwing TNT and slightly better armor.

## Maps
Dominate launches with just two maps, but we plan to add more in the future.


### Stony
A symmetrical map where the outer points are the highest areas of the map. The center point is surrounded by water, allowing swimmers to quickly traverse the map.

### Lunar
Each team has an objective close to its spawn. The fastest way (but not the only way) to get between these areas is to travel through the middle, where there is a third objective. A large crater separates the two outer points.

# Other Updates
- BlueDragon is now on **Minecraft 1.20.1**. This doesn't mean any drastic changes, but you will now be able to play on the latest version!
- A new **tic-tac-toe minigame** has been added to the lobby. Find it on the first island of the World Tour Parkour.
- If you haven't seen it, we recently [fixed a critical bug in FastFall](https://bluedragonmc.com/blog/2023-06-12-fall-damage-glitch) and made some adjustments to the leaderboards.

That's all for today! We hope you enjoy the new game, and as always, have a great day!
