## All-New Leaderboards

_The leaderboard display in the lobby._

Leaderboards are updated every 5-10 minutes and displayed on maps in the lobby. They use statistics gathered by the games, such as highest score, more wins, or fastest time.

## Statistics

Currently we are keeping track of the amount of wins for each game as well as some individual statistics for FastFall and Infinijump. We are looking to add more trackable statistics in the future.

## Leaderboard Browser

Leaderboards which are not featured on map displays can be viewed at any time using the new Leaderboard Browser in the lobby.

Leaderboards are grouped by category, and each category can contain a collection of leaderboards related to a game. Currently, the top 10 players are shown.

## Suggestions

If you have any suggestions for trackable statistics or have any leaderboard ideas, let us know by replying to this post or talking in our [Discord server](/discord).

Have a great day!
