## Scoring

All players are on their own team. The following actions will net you points:

- **1 point**: Dealing one heart of damage to another player
- **5 points**: Getting the last hit of a kill

The first team to reach 60 points is declared the winner!

## Painting

**Painting** is a mechanic unique to Paintbrawl. When a projectile you shoot touches the ground, it explodes, painting the nearby blocks with your team's color. If another player steps on your color, they will begin to take damage. Some weapons are more effective at painting than others, so pay attention to the one that you have!

## Weapons

There are currently 5 weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each time you respawn, you will receive a new random weapon.

_Note: Weapon mobility refers to the amount of self-knockback that can be done with them. Weapons do not affect the player's movement speed._

- **Paintball Gun**: The standard weapon, with average statistics in most categories.
- **Machine Gun**: Ultra fast firing weapon with high mobility, but low paint area and damage per hit.
- **Shotgun**: Fires multiple shells at once. Ideal for close-quarters combat.
- **Sniper**: Difficult to aim, but highly rewarding, dealing 8 hearts of damage per shot. High mobility and paint area.
- **Paintbrush**: Paints a very large area, at the cost of mobility, fire rate, and damage.

## Powerups

There are currently 6 powerups, which are collectible items that provide a temporary boost to one player. These powerups spawn at a random location on the map, and a new one spawns 10 seconds after the last one is picked up.

- **Fast Firing**: Fire your weapon and reload twice as fast for 20 seconds.
- **Super Damage**: Deal double damage with your weapon for 30 seconds.
- **Super Paint Area**: Increases the paint size of your weapon by 2 for 30 seconds.
- **Paint Vacuum**: Nearby paint that is not your team's color will be removed. Lasts for 15 seconds.
- **Health Pack**: Heals you a total of 5 hearts over a period of 5 seconds.
- **Nuke**: Detonates after 5 seconds, damaging players in a 4-block radius, destroying blocks in a 5-block radius, and painting blocks in an 8-block radius. If you move after picking up the powerup, the detonation occurs where you moved to.

## Maps

If all that wasn't enough, Paintbrawl has 5 maps to change things up! Each map has varying amounts of cover, symmetry, and verticality, so they all feel different to play on.

What are you still doing here? Go play some Paintbrawl! And, as always, have a great day!
