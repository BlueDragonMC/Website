We have just released a **new game mode** for Infinijump: **Versus**.

## Versus Mode
Between two and eight players can join an Infinijump Versus game. Each player gets their own world and set of parkour blocks, and the longest-surviving player wins.

A new category has been added to the leaderboards for both modes, Solo and Versus. The combined leaderboard is still displayed in the lobby.

In addition to the new mode, we have been making more and more internal changes which make BlueDragon easier to manage and maintain. If you want to get some insight into that, check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/Server).

As always, suggestions can be left as replies to this thread, in our [Ideas](https://bluedragonmc.com/t/ideas) subforum, or on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3gvSPdW).

Have a great day!
