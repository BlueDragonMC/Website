**Infinijump** has just been released, a twist on the classic Minecraft parkour maps and gamemodes. It features a randomly-generated endless parkour course that gets harder as the game goes on. How far will you make it?

## Blocks
Blocks are generated in advance, so there will always be three blocks in front of you. Once a block is generated, a countdown timer begins. When the timer gets to zero, the block will disappear. The outline around the block shows you how close it is to disappearing. The amount of time the block lives is based on the difficulty (see below).
## Score
Every game starts at 0 points. You earn one point for each successful jump. If a block is skipped, points are still awarded for that block when the next one is reached.
## Difficulty
New difficulties are automatically switched to after their point requirements are met.
- **Easy** (0 points): Each new block takes 6 seconds to disappear.
- **Medium** (50 points): Each new block takes 5.25 seconds to disappear. Jumps are slightly harder than Easy.
- **Hard** (100 points): Each new block takes 4.5 seconds to disappear. Jumps are slightly harder than Medium.
- **Very Hard** (150 points): Each new block takes 3.75 seconds to disappear. Jumps are slightly harder than Hard.

## Future Updates
We have some more Infinijump content planned for the near future.
- **Party Mode**: Everyone in a party will be able to play separate games of Infinijump at the same time. Whoever survives the longest will be the winner!
- **Leaderboards**: Soon, you will be able to compete for the highest score!
