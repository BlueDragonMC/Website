To make BlueDragon a better place, we have a set of simple rules. Nothing too crazy, just the standard stuff. It is up to the discretion of the moderator whether you have broken the rules.

# Gameplay Rules

- No use of gameplay-altering modifications is allowed. Visual and performance mods like Sodium and Iris are allowed.
- No griefing or sabotaging teammates unless the game specifically allows it.
- Do not abuse glitches or exploits in the game to gain an unfair advantage. Please [report](/discord) any bugs in our Discord server.
- Do not log in with another account or otherwise attempt to evade a punishment. This will result in a longer or stricter punishment.

# Forum and Chat Rules

- Swearing is allowed, but don't swear excessively.
- No bullying or harassment. Treat others with respect.
- Do not promote or participate in illegal activity.
- Do not spam or use excessive caps.
- In general, if you follow Mojang's [community standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards), you won't have an issue with BlueDragon.
